### 👋 Hi there, I’m Andrea

I got my introduction to the fantastic world of web development through [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) over 10 years ago and I fell in love right away ❤️

Since then, I chose to focus exclusively on Frontend development. I dove deep into TypeScript and one of the major UI libraries out there React.js.

Right now, I’m part of the amazing team at Adesso.it where I’m building a large-scale application for a well-known travel agency.

I truly enjoy this field and am constantly learning new things that help me translate complex problems into intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces thanks in large part to the excellent designers I’ve been lucky to work with along the way 😊

#### 🧰 My toolbox  
HTML · CSS (SCSS) · TypeScript · React.js · Next.js · Redux · TailwindCSS · TanStack Query · React Hook Form · Zod · Recharts

#### 👀 What I’m exploring  
Learning blockchain development, experimenting with AI and MCP, and having fun with Svelte

#### 💪 How I keep my skills sharp  
Staying up to date is a top priority for me. I enjoy following [Egghead courses](https://egghead.io/) and discovered the great teaching style of Kent C. Dodds. I invested in his [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/) and [TestingJavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) courses to deepen my knowledge. You can even check out my notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/EpicReactNotes).

I also pick up Udemy courses occasionally especially when I find an instructor who’s a great resource. I’ll share some of my favorites here next time I update this 😉

#### 👨‍💻 Side projects  
I’m still early in my public career and many projects are works in progress or repos on GitHub. However, one project I’m proud of that’s live is:

##### 🌅 [ImgBundle](https://imgbundle.vercel.app/)  
A simple app that lets you search the [Unsplash archive](https://unsplash.com/), select as many images as you want, and download them all in a `.zip` file.

#### 💬 Fancy a chat?  
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/a_barghigiani). If we get along, I’ll probably share my email too 😉
