### 👋 Hi there, here's Andrea 

Got my introduction to the fantastic web development field with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) more than 10 years ago, and I fell in love right away ❤️

Then I made a career choice and focused exclusively on FrontEnd development, and I started to learn JavaScript and invest deeply into one of the major UI libraries out there known as React.js.

Right now, I am part of the team of [Enhancers](https://enhancers.it/) where I work primarily with, you guess, React.js.

I really love this field, and I am constantly learning new things that improve my work and my ability to translate complex problems into interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, well this is primarily thanks to the excellent designer that luckily I've met during my career 😊

#### 🧰 My toolbox 
HTML - CSS (SCSS) - JavaScript - React.js - Typescript - Next.js - Redux - TailwindCSS 

#### 👀 I am practicing with
Web3 - Building side projects with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

#### 💪 How do I improve my skills? 
Keep my knowledge sharp and current has always been my main focus, in order to do so I found great pleasure following [Egghead courses](https://egghead.io/) that let me discover all the materials of Kent C. Dodds. Since I like (a lot) he's teaching style I invested in [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/) and [TestingJavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) to help me dig deeper in both. You can even read my notes right here on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/EpicReactNotes)

I even buy some Udemy courses from time to time, especially if I find in the teacher a good resource to learn from. Will add some of the *best of* next time I'll read this 😉

#### 👨‍💻 Side projects 
I am early in my (public) career so I have not much to offer, at least for now, but I am try to build in public so probably you'll see something in this section in the near future.
