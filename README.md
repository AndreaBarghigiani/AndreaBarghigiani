### 👋 Hi there, here's Andrea 

Got my introduction to the amazing web development field with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) more than 10 years ago and I felt in love right away ❤️
At the beginning WordPress gave me the opportunity to jump start my development without thinking about backend at all and helped me to start focusing on what (I discovered) I really enjoyed of web development: the Front End 🎉 

Transform code into amazing UI that amaze the users of the apps I build gives me joy 🤩

After spending many years building WordPres themes and small plugins for my clients I decided to move on and leave the freelance career to join a company that would let me work (and keep learning) on the part that I really love of the Front End: JavaScript.

Right now I am part of the amazing team of [WPMU DEV](https://premium.wpmudev.org/) where I work mostly with React.js creating the Hub, a piece of cake that helps thousands of customers to manage the WordPress installations of their clients.

I really love this field and I am constantly learning new things that improve my work and my ability to translate complex problems into interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, well this is mostly thanks to the amazing designer that luckly I've met during my career 😊

#### 🧰 What's in my toolbox? 
HTML - CSS (SCSS) - JavaScript - React.js - Redux - Emotion - PHP

#### 👀 What's am I adding in my toolbox? 
Typescript - Next.js - Chakra UI - PostgreSQL (just enough to be dangerous 😂) 

#### 💪 How do I improve my skills? 
Keep my knowledge sharp and current has always been my main focus, in order to do so I found great pleasure following [Egghead courses](https://egghead.io/) that let me discover all the materials of Kent C. Dodds. Since I like (a lot) he's teaching style I invested in [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/) and [TestingJavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) to help me dig deeper in both. You can even read my notes right here on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/EpicReactNotes)

#### 👨‍💻 Side projects 
I am early in my (public) career so I have not much to offer, at least for now, but I am try to build in public so you right now [I am developing a tool for my own company](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/pmdreamland) (that they didn't ask for but it is a good way to practice new skills I am learning 😊). Hopefully in the near future you'll see more stuff in this list, included my portfolio 😂

#### 💬 Fancy a chat? 
You can find my public self on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cupofcraft) but if we get along probably I'll give you my email too 😉
