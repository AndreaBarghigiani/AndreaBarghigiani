### 👋 Hi there, here's Andrea 

Got my introduction to the amazing web development field with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) more than 10 years ago and I felt in love right away ❤️

Then I make a career choice in Front End development and I started to learn JavaScript and invest deeply into one of the mayor UI libraries out there known as React.js.

But you know devs right? They're curious creatures so lately I've started to learn deeply Ruby and Ruby on Rails, also because this is the flavour at my new company, and have to say that the power of the framework and the simplicity of the language exited me.

Right now I am part of the amazing team of [Odd Camp](https://www.oddcamp.com/) where I work mostly with, you guess, Ruby on Rails where we use to create fast web applications for our clients. Since my focus is more on the Front End side of it I am using hevily the new ViewComponents and start to master Hotwire.

I really love this field and I am constantly learning new things that improve my work and my ability to translate complex problems into interfaces that are intuitive and easy to use, well this is mostly thanks to the amazing designer that luckly I've met during my career 😊

#### 🧰 My toolbox 
HTML - CSS (SCSS) - JavaScript - React.js - Redux - Emotion - PHP

#### 👀 I am practicing with
*The JavaScript part:*
Typescript - Next.js - Chakra UI

*The Ruby part:*
ViewComponents - Hotwire

#### 💪 How do I improve my skills? 
Keep my knowledge sharp and current has always been my main focus, in order to do so I found great pleasure following [Egghead courses](https://egghead.io/) that let me discover all the materials of Kent C. Dodds. Since I like (a lot) he's teaching style I invested in [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/) and [TestingJavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/) to help me dig deeper in both. You can even read my notes right here on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaBarghigiani/EpicReactNotes)

I even buy some Udemy courses from time to time, especially if I find in the teacher a good resource to learn from. Will add some of the *best of* next time I'll read this 😉

#### 👨‍💻 Side projects 
I am early in my (public) career so I have not much to offer, at least for now, but I am try to build in public so probably you'll see something in this section in the near future.

#### 💬 Fancy a chat? 
You can find my public self on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cupofcraft) but if we get along probably I'll give you my email too 😉
